# BME680_ESP8266
Hello everyone! This is a nice little project that I did to improve my skills. The base of this project is the NodeMCU-v3 and the Bosch BME680 on a Adafruit board. I chose this sensor because it is a sensor with a very high precision and it can show several things. It can show temperature, humidity, pressure, gas resistance and altitude. It has very low quiescent current and it is very easy to connect through I2C. I connected the sensor to NodeMCU through the next pins: VIN(node) to 3.3V(sensor), ground to ground, D1(node clock pin-SCL) to SCK(sensor) and D2(node data pin-SDA) to SDI(sensor). I also used the NodeMCU deep-sleep mode so I connected D0 to reset pin. The whole system is powered from 2 18650 Li-Ion cells(use BMS module!!!) and I use a DC-DC dc buck converter to step down the voltage to approximately 5V. Please be careful if you want to use battery, you can either connect to 3.3V pin(with no voltage regulation) or to VIN pin(so it can pass through NodeMCU integrad LDO-low dropout regulator). The code can be used to send data to any other platform.
